## AIM

    `locpol` package tries to cover Local Polynomial estimation with weights. The package has been used by the author to study and make inference for lenght biased data and biased data in general. 




## Thanks

* José Antonio Cristóbal Cristóbal, José Tomás Alcalá Nalváiz (U. of Zaragoza) who introduced me to the problem of Local Polynomial estimation for biased data and the compensation strategy.

* Other contributions:  
    + Hiroyuki Kawakatsu (Business School, Dublin City University) who pointed some bugs in code and docs.




## a little History
